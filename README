The simplest way to use this project is to install the .deb file. This
was tested under Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper).

Otherwise, you may compile the code with the script 'makeit'. The
script 'installit' will install the package, so you can import it as
a module under python.

Once the project is installed, you can test it by running

python test.py

This does a simple torrent download. Note that the torrent is for
the Ubuntu 6.06 release, and was available as of 15.9.2006. You
may need to replace the torrent with another.

If successful, you will see test.py print the torrent status
to the screen each second. Notice in particular the download speed
and amount downloaded so far, to see if things are working.

Note: You may need to change the port used, depending on your system.
