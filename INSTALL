================================= 
Installation of python-libtorrent
=================================

Compile:         python setup.py build
Compile&install: sudo python setup.py install

Dependencies to compile (written as Ubuntu packages): python, libboost-filesystem1.33.1, libboost-date-time1.33.1, libboost-program-options1.33.1, libboost-regex1.33.1, libboost-thread1.33.1, libc6-dev, zlib1g-dev

May also depend on (not sure): python-dev, and -dev packages for all boost libs

Note: Makefile.libtorrent-only.* are the makefiles from libtorrent, copies as it. They don't refer to python-libtorrent, and probably won't work in the current directory structure. However, they may help people know what dependencies etc. are needed
