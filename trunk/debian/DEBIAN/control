Description: A Python wrapper for the (Sourceforge, not Rakshasa!) libtorrent C++ library. As libtorrent is not available in the Ubuntu repos at present (the Raksasha version is), this package contains both the wrapper for python, and the actual libtorrent library itself. That library is available as a standalone at http://libtorrent.sourceforge.net/ under the original license, which is a 3-clause BSD-type license. This package, consisting of both the wrapper and (perhaps slightly modified) code from the libtorrent project, is licensed under the GPL (version 2 or above).
